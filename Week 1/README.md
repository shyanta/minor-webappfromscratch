##Week 1:
###Pros and Cons JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries

####Pros:
- Efficiency
  - Where some tasks may use lots of code and time, Javascript libraries
  	usually can down this. Less code and far less time. This makes the
  	developing a lot easier to use and learn and this wil save time.
- Security
  - The users of the framework are also the testers of the framework.
  	Where a users finds a mistake, they can report this at the frameworks
  	website. The framework will fix it, and every users will profit.
- Great documentation and tutorials
  - A framework wil usually come with a proper documentation about how
  	to use it. Also it often has a support team or big forums where most
  	of your questions will be answered.

####Cons:
- You only learn the framework
  - When you use a framework and learn its language. You didn't learn the language
  	behind this framework. So you may know how to use and write jQuery, you still 
  	don't know how to write raw JavaScript.
- Functionality may be limited
  - However frameworks provides lots of possibilities, compared to Raw JavaScript
	 these possibilities are often limited. With the use of Raw JavaScript 
	 you can accomplish more than frameworks can offer you.
- Updates
  - In contrast to raw JavaScript, with frameworks you are depentend on updates and
  	actions of the framework. These updates can affect some features of your website.

####Why don't we use jQuery
The reason that we aren't using jQuery in this minor is quite simple. The most common rule
that I've learned is that you have to learn the main language first. When you understand that
you can broaden your knowlegde by learning other functions, based on this language. Learning a
librarie without knowing the language it's based on isn't a logic order. Most people start with 
jQuery, simply because it's easier to learn and understand. But your starting with a language that
is far more limited than JavaScript itself. When your starting with JavaScript and learn this,
you can accomplish much greater things.

###Pros and Cons of a Single Web Page Application

####Pros:
- No refresh
  - Users can get what they want, when they want it. It increases the responsiveness and the backend becomes far more easy.
- Quality over quantity
  - Developers can focus on one single webpage. A webpage with more quality. It takes a lot of time to design a good webpage.
  Having to focus on less webpages, makes that you can put more time on these pages, which makes the quality much higher.

####Cons:
- Large file size
  - Because you are loading multiple elements on a single page, it will load slower than a normal webpage would.
  Don't be scared to make a scrollable webpage. Images and videos shouldn't be stacked on top of each other.
- Only one entry point
  - When making a single web page application the user can enter the site only on the first state of the app.
  When they want to go to a specific part inside this app, the have to restart the app and repeat the steps
  to get there.
