#Usage
In this application you can search for gifs.
At the home page a list of trending gifs is shown. These gifs will change every once in a while.
You can search with any keyword you want and the application will search the giphy database for gifs that have the tag that you searched on.
When the results are loaded you can look at a detail page where the clicked gif is shown.
You can see who posted the gif if they have a username.
The detail page needs more information, you can read what this information contains
at the Wishlist in this README.md.

#Wishlist
The extra feature I've wanted to add is an Google Search API.
The api should be used at the detail page of a gif.
The URL of the gif can be placed at google image search, this way people
can see on what sites the gif has been used.
